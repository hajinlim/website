My research interest lies in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), specifically in Computer-supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Social Computing. I am primarily interested in exploring how social science theories can be used to design and develop social computing systems that promote effective communication among individuals, groups, and organizations. Through my research, I intend to further the empirical, practical and theoretical understanding of human relationships and communications in online environments.
