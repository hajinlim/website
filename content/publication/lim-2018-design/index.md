abstract = "Machine translation is often not enough for people to engage across languages due to translation errors and lack of cultural background. In addressing these challenges, my dissertation explores how AI-augmented analytics can improve computer-mediated communication between speakers of different native languages. First, to support better sense making of foreign language posts in social media, I designed SenseTrans, a tool that adds contextual information using AI-analytics such as sentiment analysis. In my future work, I intend to explore 1) how people perceive, interpret and make use of AI-generated information, and 2) how AI-augmented analytics could be applied to other settings."
